/**
 * <p>
 * This package contains all classes to show an interactive map of a world in a JavaFX application that is highly customizable (or will be in the future). The
 * most important class is {@link togos.minecraft.maprend.gui.WorldRendererCanvas}, a Canvas that loads and renders the world map. But it is recommended to use
 * {@link togos.minecraft.maprend.gui.MapPane} instead, which will wrap the canvas in a GUI with proper layout and the possibility to add decorations and
 * interactive functionality.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This package is still under development. Everything might be subject to change. Use at own risk.
